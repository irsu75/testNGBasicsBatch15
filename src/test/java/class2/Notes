2.SoftAssertions:

Soft asseertion will execute all assertions that are there despite of the fact that they FAIL or PASS
and once it has evaluated them all then it will mark the test case as
Failed or Passed
(it marks it failed even if one assertion has failed)

The advantage of using soft asssert is that we can
see what errors we are having in other assertions that we make in the same test case
but we cant see them if we use hardassertion as IT WILL EXIT AS SOON AS THE FIRST ASSERTION FAILS

method to implement:
1. delcare the instance
softAssert soft =new softAssert();
2.make assertions

soft.assertEquals();

3. at the end of makiing all assertions
you must do
soft.assertALL()

this evalutes wether the test case has to be marked passed or failed

---------Data Provider-----------
Used for dataDriven testing
 DataProviders in TestNG are another way to pass the parameters in the test function. DataProviders pass different values to the TestNG Test Case in a single execution
@DataProvider

--> we provide our data under this annotations and should name our data provider @DataProvider(name="abc")

-->in which ever test case we want to use this data we simply link the data provider to that test case
  @Test(dataprovider="abc")

//dataprovider -->use it when u have small data
in case of larger data use excel file


if we want our test case to utilize this dataprovider
what do we need to do?
@test(dataprovider ="name of dataprovider")
public void test(){


}
